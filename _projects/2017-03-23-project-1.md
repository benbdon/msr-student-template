## Overview
Over the course of my winter semester 2018 at Northwestern, I developed a Drum Machine (literally). I say "literally" because typically when people say "drum machine" colloquially, they are referring to piece of digital electronics that be programmed to mimic the sound of drums. Other than buttons, there is nothing using or applying mechanical power. However, my brings meaning back to the phase "drum machine".

For this independent project, I combined the skills gained in Advanced Computer Vision (EECS432), Feedback Controls (EECS360), Mechatronics (ME333) together to build a drum machine. It reads actual sheet music for a drum set and interprets it into an array of control timing information. This timing array is sent to the drum stick controller(s) which each take a different line from the music and strike when commanded.

### Project Motivation
I've played the drums for many years and accumulated many, many stacks of drum music. Some of the music is quite complex to play consistently even if you know exactly when to play what drum.It can become get quite complex when the tempo increases and the number of limbs moving independently approaches 4. Cue the Drum Machine! This robot can read and play sheet music automatically (assuming the music adheres to some guidelines).

#### WRITE - Sheet Music Generation
The music provided in this Github is from "1001 Drum Grooves: The Complete Resource for Every Drummer" by Steve Mansfield. To ensure I had a non-noisy version of the music with respect to image quality and full customization of how the notes are displayed on the screen, I transcribed each line of music using the free sheet music composition tool, MuseScore (available on Windows/Mac/Linux).


#### READ - Interpret the Sheet Music (Machine/Computer Vision)
While one might assume that sheet music has been around for centuries and therefore has reached a standard, this is not the case. For example, the hi-hat cymbal is listed as an F by some music composers and G by others. Even the direction of the stem (up or down) from the note can vary by composer. The duration of the note can be written many different ways, yet when played they all sound the same. In drumming, the length of a note is arbitrary as long. Fundamentally, this is due to an actual drum hit having finite duration. In other words, a hit on beats 2 and 4 can be written countless different ways yet still sound the same. I've written 3 examples below.

Therefore to adhere to some music standard for this project, I focused on sheet music from only one book and eight different rhythms.

Code Overview: The software leveraged a Hough Circle Transform from OpenCV to detect the (x,y) pixel locations of each note on the page. After tuning the parameters, the detection went from

to

Next I filtered out the extraneous false positives using a bounding box and isolated notes too close together as duplicates. Since the note for the hi-hat is represented as an X rather than a circle, it would often trigger 2 circle detections rather than simply one.

Finally, I went column by column detecting the flag at the top to determine the note duration for one of more of the notes below. Since technically I had only the note center as a reference, I checked both the left and right of it for the flag. FYI: Two beams is a 16th note and 1 beam is an 8th not.

Since I intentionally selected music where 16th notes were the shortest possible note, I could infer an array of length 32 (16 possible notes per measure x 2 measures) would be enough to store all the notes and rests. Note by note, column by column the music was converted from traditional music notes to 3 x 32 array of 1's and 0's.

#### MOVE - Command the Stick Up and Down
Using a proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) control loop to command motor acceleration to move the drumstick to a desired start angle relative to the surface of the drum. I close the control loop using quadrature encoder pulses (i.e. angle) as an input and command both pulse-width modulation (PWM) motor direction as output. Once the stick reaches it's start angle, it waits to receive a "1". Once received, it moves downwards at 100% PWM until the angle reaches ~0 degrees. Then the motor switches back to PID control to return back to the start angle.
